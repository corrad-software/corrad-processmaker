# Backend Services

The project uses Nuxt's server directory for backend API endpoints and services.

## API Endpoints

Check the [server](mdc:server) directory for API routes:
- Authentication routes (login, register, password reset)
- User management
- Form builder APIs
- Data access endpoints

## Database Access

The application uses Prisma ORM to interact with the database:
- Models defined in [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma)
- Database operations through Prisma Client
- Migrations managed through Prisma Migration

## Authentication

The authentication system includes:
- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing and verification
- Role-based access control
- Session management

## Middleware

Server middleware handles:
- Request validation
- Authentication verification
- Error handling
- Response formatting
